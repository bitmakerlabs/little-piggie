show notes:

* first sinatra app:
no routes, just:

require 'sinatra'


next: static hello world / complement

next: randomly sampled complement

add insults to show basic route matching

we added a hello route to demonstrate query string parameters, and a result dependent on user input
  => later on, show that /hello/ryan does NOT work

we added a goodbye route that shows off named parameters

routing in sinatra is pretty powerful and i encourage you to look at the documentation for sinatra to find out more. for example, there's something called splat which lets you match almost anything you can think of.

added an erb string template indicating the current time. - what's erb for?
how do you interpret ruby inside an erb string.

add an erb template file.


added fancy compliments - a barely styled erb page.

added fancy insults - which uses a layout file and embeds the template inside
